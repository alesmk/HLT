# HLT Project

Human Language Technologies 2023/24 Project

Goal: _Cyberbullying Classification_


ToDo: solit the Dataset at the beginning of all project to perform metrics only in the test set, that will be the same for all the models.

Divide the normalize function to make it in common for all the BERT models. We may also add the BERT normalize function to the preprocessing file.
